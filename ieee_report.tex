\begin{abstract}

This study presents a comprehensive data mining analysis of the RMS Titanic disaster using a dataset of 891 passengers. Through statistical analysis, correlation studies, and visualization techniques, we examine the relationship between passenger characteristics and survival outcomes. Our findings reveal significant disparities in survival rates based on gender, passenger class, and age, with women and children showing substantially higher survival rates than adult men. The analysis demonstrates clear socioeconomic stratification effects, where higher-class passengers not only paid significantly more for their tickets but also had dramatically better survival prospects. The overall survival rate was 38.38\%, with women achieving 74.20\% survival compared to 18.89\% for men, and first-class passengers showing 62.96\% survival versus 24.24\% for third-class passengers.

\section{INTRODUCTION}

The sinking of the RMS Titanic on April 15, 1912, remains one of the most studied maritime disasters in history. Beyond its historical significance, the event provides a unique dataset for examining human behavior under extreme circumstances and the impact of social stratification on survival outcomes. This analysis employs modern data mining techniques to explore patterns in passenger survival, focusing on demographic and socioeconomic factors.

The dataset contains information on 891 passengers, including survival status, passenger class, age, gender, family relationships, and ticket fare. This study addresses several key research questions: (1) How do demographic factors influence survival rates? (2) What is the relationship between socioeconomic status and survival outcomes? (3) To what extent was the "women and children first" evacuation policy followed?

Our most significant findings include: (1) Women had a 74.20\% survival rate compared to 18.89\% for men, providing strong evidence for the "women and children first" policy; (2) First-class passengers achieved 62.96\% survival versus 24.24\% for third-class passengers, demonstrating clear socioeconomic disparities; and (3) Children (≤16 years) had a 55.00\% survival rate compared to 38.27\% for adults, supporting the "children first" aspect of the evacuation policy.

\section{DATA}

The analysis is based on the Titanic passenger dataset containing 891 passenger records with 12 features. The dataset includes both demographic and socioeconomic information:

\textbf{Demographic Variables:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{PassengerId:} Unique identifier for each passenger
\item \textbf{Survived:} Binary variable (0 = did not survive, 1 = survived)
\item \textbf{Sex:} Gender of the passenger (male/female)
\item \textbf{Age:} Age of the passenger in years (177 missing values, 19.9\% of dataset)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Socioeconomic Variables:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Pclass:} Passenger class (1 = luxury, 2 = middle, 3 = lower)
\item \textbf{Fare:} Ticket price paid by the passenger
\item \textbf{Cabin:} Room assignment (available for some passengers)
\item \textbf{Embarked:} Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Family Variables:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{SibSp:} Number of siblings/spouses aboard
\item \textbf{Parch:} Number of parents/children aboard
\item \textbf{NotAlone:} Binary variable created during analysis (0 = traveling alone, 1 = with family)
\end{itemize}

The dataset exhibits 8.10\% overall missing data, with age being the primary source of missing values. A new binary variable, \textit{NotAlone}, was created to indicate whether passengers traveled with family members, defined as having at least one sibling, spouse, parent, or child aboard.

\section{RESULTS}

\subsection{Statistical Analysis}

Population-based statistical measures were implemented from first principles, including variance ($\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum(x - \mu)^2}{N}$), standard deviation ($\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}$), and correlation coefficients. The correlation matrix revealed several interesting relationships:

\begin{itemize}
\item Strong positive correlation between \textit{SibSp} and \textit{Parch} (0.415), indicating family travel patterns
\item Moderate positive correlation between \textit{Fare} and \textit{Survived} (0.257), supporting the class effect
\item Negative correlation between \textit{Age} and \textit{SibSp} (-0.308), suggesting younger passengers traveled with more siblings
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Survival Analysis by Demographics}

The analysis revealed dramatic disparities in survival outcomes:

\textbf{Gender Effects:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Women: 74.20\% survival rate (233 out of 314)
\item Men: 18.89\% survival rate (109 out of 577)
\item Difference: 55.31 percentage points
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Passenger Class Effects:}
\begin{itemize}
\item First Class: 62.96\% survival rate (136 out of 216)
\item Second Class: 47.28\% survival rate (87 out of 184)
\item Third Class: 24.24\% survival rate (119 out of 491)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Age Effects:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Children (≤16 years): 55.00\% survival rate
\item Adults (>16 years): 38.27\% survival rate
\item Children in Class 3 (≤10 years): 43.18\% survival rate
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Socioeconomic Stratification}

The analysis revealed clear socioeconomic stratification:
\begin{itemize}
\item First Class: Average fare \$84.15, mean age 38.23 years
\item Second Class: Average fare \$20.66, mean age 29.88 years
\item Third Class: Average fare \$13.68, mean age 25.14 years
\end{itemize}

First-class passengers paid 6.15 times more than third-class passengers and were significantly older on average.

\subsection{Data Distribution Analysis}

\textbf{Age Distribution:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Standard deviation: 14.52 years
\item Interquartile range: 17.88 years (Q1=20.12, Q3=38.00)
\item Range: 0.4 to 80.0 years
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Fare Distribution:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Standard deviation: \$49.67
\item Interquartile range: \$23.09 (Q1=\$7.91, Q3=\$31.00)
\item Range: \$0.00 to \$512.33
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Causal Inference Analysis}

\textbf{Potential Causes of Survival:}

Several factors appear to have influenced survival outcomes during the Titanic disaster:

1. \textbf{Gender and Social Norms:} The "women and children first" evacuation policy was clearly implemented, as evidenced by the 55.31 percentage point difference between male and female survival rates.

2. \textbf{Socioeconomic Status:} Higher-class passengers had better access to lifeboats (typically located on upper decks) and may have received preferential treatment during evacuation.

3. \textbf{Physical Location:} First-class passengers were likely closer to lifeboat stations and had better access to evacuation routes.

4. \textbf{Social Pressure and Cultural Expectations:} The era's social norms may have influenced individual behavior and crew decisions during the evacuation.

\textbf{"Women and Children First" Policy:}

The data provides strong evidence that the "women and children first" evacuation policy was followed. Women's survival rate (74.20\%) was nearly four times higher than men's (18.89\%), and children had a 16.73 percentage point advantage over adults. The most extreme example is women in first class, who achieved a 96.81\% survival rate, compared to men in third class at 13.54\%.

\textbf{Statistical Analysis Assessment:}

The correlation analysis provides valuable insights but has limitations:

\textbf{Strengths:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Hand-coded statistical functions ensure precise calculations
\item Population-based formulas provide educational value
\item Correlation matrix reveals meaningful relationships between variables
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Limitations and Areas for Improvement:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Missing Data:} 177 missing age values (19.9\%) may bias results
\item \textbf{Confounding Variables:} Unmeasured factors (crew status, exact location on ship, physical condition) may influence survival
\item \textbf{Selection Bias:} Dataset may not represent complete passenger manifest
\item \textbf{Temporal Factors:} Order of evacuation and timing of lifeboat deployment varied by location
\item \textbf{Non-linear Relationships:} Correlation analysis assumes linear relationships
\item \textbf{Small Sample Sizes:} Some subgroups (e.g., children in first class) have very small sample sizes
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Recommended Improvements:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Implement multiple imputation for missing age data
\item Conduct sensitivity analysis for different age imputation methods
\item Perform logistic regression to control for multiple variables simultaneously
\item Analyze interaction effects between variables
\item Consider non-parametric tests for non-normal distributions
\item Include additional data sources (crew records, detailed evacuation timelines)
\end{itemize}

\section{CONCLUSIONS}

This data mining analysis of the Titanic disaster reveals significant disparities in survival outcomes based on gender, passenger class, and age. The findings provide strong evidence for the "women and children first" evacuation policy and demonstrate the impact of socioeconomic stratification on survival during the disaster.

The analysis highlights the importance of considering multiple factors when examining survival outcomes and underscores the need for careful interpretation of statistical associations. While the data reveals clear patterns, causal relationships must be interpreted with caution due to potential confounding variables and selection biases.

Future research could benefit from additional data sources, including crew records, detailed evacuation timelines, and passenger locations during the disaster. Such information would provide deeper insights into the mechanisms underlying the observed survival patterns.

The statistical analysis, while providing valuable insights, could be enhanced through more sophisticated techniques such as logistic regression, machine learning algorithms, and sensitivity analysis for missing data. These improvements would strengthen the causal inference capabilities of the analysis.
